# About Me


Hello! I'm Junior Full-Stack web developer with a background in Human Biology. I am passionate about learning and combining different frameworks and libraries used in web design, such as integrating React with Phaser (game Engine) along with Sockets. My work experience as a product manager in Beijing, and internship at Silicon Valley taught me the importance of careful planning, design, and execution for the task given. Currently, I have a deep interests in using ReactJS as well as Sockets to create fast, and responsive web experiences.
